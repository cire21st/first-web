    <p>I text a postcard, sent to you, did it go through?
        Sending all my love to you
        You are the moonlight of my life every night
        Giving all my love to you
    </P>
    <p>My beating heart belongs to you
      I walked for miles 'til I found you
      I'm here to honor you
      If I lose everything in the fire
      I'm sending all my love to you
    </P>
    <p>With every breath that I am worth here on Earth
      I'm sending all my love to you
      So if you dare to second guess, you can rest
      Assured that all my love's for you
    </P>
    <p>My beating heart belongs to you
      I walked for miles 'til I found you
      I'm here to honor you
      If I lose everything in the fire
      I'm sending all my love to you
    </P>
    <p>My beating heart belongs to you
      I walked for miles 'til I found you
      I'm here to honor you
      If I lose everything in the fire
      Did I ever make it through?
    </p>
